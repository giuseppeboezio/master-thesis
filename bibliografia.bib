abstract = {The programming language, Prolog, was born of a project aimed not at producing a programming language but at processing natural languages; in this case, French. The project gave rise to a preliminary version of Prolog at the end of 1971 and a more definitive version at the end of 1972. This article gives the history of this project and describes in detail the preliminary and then the final versions of Prolog. The authors also felt it appropriate to describe the Q-systems since it was a language which played a prominent part in Prolog's genesis.},

abstract = {To date, logic-based technologies are either built on top or as extensions of the Prolog language, mostly working as monolithic solutions tailored upon specific inference procedures, unification mechanisms, or knowledge representation techniques. Instead, to maximise their impact, logic-based technologies should support and enable the general-purpose exploitation of all the manifold contributions from logic programming. Accordingly, we present 2P-Kt, a reboot of the tuProlog project offering a general, extensible, and interoperable ecosystem for logic programming and symbolic AI.}
