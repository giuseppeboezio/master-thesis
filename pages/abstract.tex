2P-Kt is an interpreter for Prolog language which can be easily extended and customized to deal with
specific needs. In the current scenario Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) has been supported by this system using an interface which is
as close as possible to the predicates' signatures used by famous and most used CLP(X) family of libraries supported by SWI Prolog interpreter.\newline
A real case study concerning school timetabling is described to show a practical usage of CLP(FD) library implemented with the aforementioned 2P-Kt interpreter.
This case study shows how libraries have been modularized in such a way that they can be used as dependencies in every project developed for the Java
Virtual Machine (JVM).\newline
Constraint Logic Programming represents only a particular scenario for logic programming: for this reason a framework which extends the
mechanism of Labelled Variables to all kind of terms has been implemented to show how it is possible to frame all variations and extensions of logic programming under a
single language reducing the huge amount of existing languages and libriaries and focusing more on how to manage different domain needs using labels
which can be associated to every kind of term.
