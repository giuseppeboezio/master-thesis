\section{Requirements}\label{sec:Requirements}

As described in section \ref{subsec:2p_kt}, 2P-Kt is an exensible framework which has different mechanisms
which could be used to add to the standard Prolog other features; in this case we deal with Constraint Logic Programing (CLP).\newline
The main purpose of the following project is to implement CLP libraries in 2P-Kt having the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the interface of the predicates exposed by the libraries must be as close as possible to the one used by SWI Prolog for CLP
    \item there are not strict requirements about how to implement libraries but a good solution would exploit on existing classes in 2P-kt
    \item the different libraries could contain different predicates wrt SWI Prolog only if it is not possible to find another solution which is compatible with the current framework
\end{itemize}
