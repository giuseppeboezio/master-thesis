\section{Requirements}\label{sec:requirements_clp}

As described in section \ref{subsec:2p_kt}, 2P-Kt is an exensible framework with different mechanisms
which could be used to add to the standard Prolog other features; in this case we deal with Constraint Logic Programing (CLP).\newline
There are existing libraries for Prolog interpreters which deal with Constraint Logic Programming. SWI Prolog uses different libraries
called CLP(X) (where is X is the domain of the variables) which are very popular and used in the Prolog community. For this reason, different libraries
have been developed which share the same predicates having the same functor/arity in such a way that for a new 2P-Kt user can be very easy and familiar to use them.\newline
The main purpose of the following project is to implement CLP libraries in 2P-Kt having the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item the interface of the predicates exposed by the libraries must be as close as possible to the one used by SWI Prolog for CLP
    \item there are not strict requirements about how to implement libraries but a good solution would exploit on existing components in 2P-kt
    \item the different libraries could contain different predicates wrt SWI Prolog only if it is not possible to find another solution which is compatible with the current framework
\end{itemize}
